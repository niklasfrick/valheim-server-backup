# valheim-server-backup
Automatic Backup for your Valheim Server worlds with 30 day history and automated Discord notifications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. This backup method uses the Dedicated Valheim Server Script from Nimdy:

* [Dedicated_Valheim_Server_Script](https://github.com/Nimdy/Dedicated_Valheim_Server_Script) - Valheim Installer and Menu System for managing your Valheim Dedicated Server. Supports Vanilla or Mod modes. Built on Ubuntu 20.04.

2. [Google Drive Upload](https://github.com/labbots/google-drive-upload) from labbots.

## Usage

### 1. Get the scripts

1. Download (or clone) a copy of `valheim-server-backup`
2. Place the scripts in `/usr/local/sbin/`or wherever you want. Be sure to set all the paths correctly if you do so
3. Give files execution permissions

```sh
chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/discord.sh
chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/vhclearbackups.sh
chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/vhserverbackup.sh
```

### 2. Set world name

1. Edit line 4 of `vhserverbackup.sh` and replace ENTERWORLDNAMEHERE with your world name to be backed up 

### 3. Set up a crontab to automate execution

1. Edit crontabs

```sh
crontab -e
```

2. On a new line place following code (this runs the backup every morning at 5am)

```sh
0 5 * * * /usr/local/sbin/vhserverbackup.sh
```

You can set the time an occurence to whatever you like. You'll find some help at [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/).
